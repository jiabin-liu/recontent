Content recommendation API


Using Python3


## Running the app with Docker
  1. Install Docker, see https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac for the instructions to install it on a Mac.
  2. Then, in the top directory of this repository, you should be able to run the app using docker-compose. Just type ```docker-compose up --build```. This will download the needed packages and run the app in the foreground.
  3. The first time you run the container, it will download and crunch the simple_wiki example. This will take about 10 minutes. You will see ```Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)``` when it is done.
  4. Browse to localhost:5000, you should see 'Content recommendation rocks!' as message.
  5. Try out the test API by using curl: ```curl localhost:5000/api/recommend/v1.0/<corpus_name> -X GET -d 'url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/scientists-salvage-insights-from-lost-satellite'```, you should see a json document returned from the engine. See the list of available corpora below, you will need to add it to the API call.

## Available corpora
The available corpora are:
  1. ```wiki-simple```: this currently returns the document ids and scores of the 5 most relevant articles from the simple wikipedia corpus.

## Adding a recommendation engine
If you write a new recommendation engine, it needs to inherit from ```Recommender``` base class, see /app/recommender/base.py. The API currently picks a recommendation engine randomly. To register your engine, add the module to the /app/recommender/ directory. Then, explicitly import the class in /app/app.py. This way, the class will be added to the list of subclasses of the Recommender base class.
